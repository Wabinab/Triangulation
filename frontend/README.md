## Template

#### Reminders
Reminders consists of a header, and a question of "how". The latter is a deliberate design to ensure active participation. The cards on template displays the question, while on the projects displays the answer, on its card-body. Red if not yet been answered. Question must be set when designing the template. How could be at start or in the middle. 


# Projects
You could add extra stuffs like template, since template is just a starting point, and we don't want to limit you to modify template before coming back. Yet, adding template stuffs have the same template limitations applied. E.g. reminders must have a question of 'how'. 

Even allow changing questions! And add extra questions.
