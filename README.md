# Triangulation
If you ever need to triangulate, to put words into actions, to implement what books and articles and blogs told you, mesh and connect multiple ideas into one aggregate, this is the ultimate app to connect them together! 

## Download
Download the latest in the [Release tab](https://github.com/Wabinab/Triangulation/releases) in Github. Currently, only windows is tested, while linux is imagined (runs on windows subsystem on linux, though), mac... one don't use mac sorry. The linux probably run on mac. 

## How to Use The Program
Start off by creating a **New Template**. For each template, you can create stage at the sidebar. **After you create a stage**, the button to create a reminder, an investment, or a checklist card will be available. How you want to do it, it's up to you. Just like you can drink water by holding a cup up to your mouth, you could also drink water by holding the cup, twist your arm 360Â° around your neck, before bringing the cup to your mouth. There are no restrictions how you're gonna execute the program. 

Once you're done with creating a template, you can go back to the home page, and create a **New Project.** You should select the template which your project should use. In this case, probably the template you created earlier. 

> Even though author built this program, author oneself is figuring out how to use it. 

### How to Update Project To Use Another Template Version
If you already created a project with an existing template, and you change the template in the meantime, the version of the template will be updated. If you now create a new project, it'll use the latest version of the template. However, if you decide to update an existing project to use the template, you could change the version by clicking on the pencil on the version. 

> **_Note! Changing the version might cause the program to break. You MUST ENSURE that you don't break it, one don't provide guarantees._** In the case you cannot save it normally, it means data loss will occur, and if you don't mind data loss, you can use the red "Unsafe Save" button beside the blue "Safe" button. Both will ask for confirmation before saving, so don't worry if you accidentally clicked it. 

### How do I change the name of the `current` stage? 
Double clicking on the name will work. Furthermore, clicking `F2` allow you to edit the name of the _currently selected_ stage. Pressing `ESC` **will save** the new name. 

**Advanced user note**: F2 only works if you didn't disable the button in your windows registry or equivalent. 

### How about changing the name of cycles? 
Similar to how you edit stage, double click or F2, then ESC to save. 

### What's the difference between `clone` (double square) and `export` in template? 
Clone will clone the same template, adding "(Clone)" to the back of the name, to another template in your template folder. You can then modify the name and whatever yourself. Useful if you already have a scaffolding, but wanted to minutely tweak the difference from there instead of creating from scratch. Similarly for projects. 

Export is designed for layman user who probably don't know how to find where the folder with the template is located, plus even if they found it, it's not in a name that they can easily understand. Therefore, the export function allow to copy the file to where they want to save it, in their own name. 

**Advanced user note:** Your data is located in the data folder where you run the app. `template` is template, `project` is project. The rest, don't touch. If anything is changed manually from the rest of the folder, the program might break. All template and project are displayed on screen in reverse order, so you have to count the number and what page you're on, do some maths, before you can find it.
